What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

An empty repository is created. This is necessary to produce the metadata
files which will be used to maintain the repository once files have been
committed to it.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 

Files still in the working directory are "marked to be commited" to the repository
with the next commit when they are added to the staging area, other files in the
working directory will not have there changes committed until they are added to
the staging area. Files in the repository can have many versions based on their
commit ID, allowing the differences between versions to be viewed and allowing
older versions to be reverted to.

What value do you think it offers?

It makes it easier to separate commits based on their logical meaning.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

By only adding logically connected files to the staging area before each commit.
